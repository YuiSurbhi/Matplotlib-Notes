# Matplotlib-Notes

![Matplotlib logotype](https://matplotlib.org/_static/logo2.svg)
**📊 Matplotlib:** Matplotlib  is a widely-used Python library for creating 🖼️ static, animated, and interactive visualizations 📈. It was originally inspired by MATLAB and aims to provide a similar plotting interface in Python 🐍.<br>

▫️ Matplotlib is a widely used Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive 
  visualizations in Python.<br>
  
▫️ The data is represented in the form of a graph.<br>

## History 📜:

▫️ Matplotlib was created by <ins>John D. Hunter</ins> in 2003.<br>

▫️ It was designed for generating plot and visualizations.<br>

## What is Pyplot 📉:

▫️ Pyplot is a submodule of Matplotlib library that provides a simple and convenient interface for plots
  and visualizations in graphs.<br>

▫️ It is typically imported as plt and is one of the most common component used in Matplotlib.<br>

## Installation 🔧:

▪️ If <ins>Python</ins> and <ins>PIP</ins> are already installed on your system, then installation of Matplotlib is very easy.<br>

▪️ Install it using this command:<br>

     pip install matplotlib

##  How can we use Matplotlib 📝:

▪️ Once Matplotlib is installed, import it into your applications by adding the <code>import</code> keyword.<br>
▪️ Matplotlib utilities lie under the <code>pyplot</code> submodule, and it is imported under <code>plt</code> alias:<br>
    
     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt 

▪️ After this, Pyplot package can be referred to as <code>plt</code>.<br>
▪️ Now Matplotlib is imported and ready to use.<br>

### Example 

     import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

     x = [5,10,15,20,25]             
     y = [6,12,18,24,30]            

     plt.plot(x,y)
     plt.show()
